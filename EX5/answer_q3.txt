We an see a clear pattern (at least in the deblurr model)in the MSE of each model per the num of res blocks,
and it is that with higher res blocks the better result we get - meaning that the loss is smaller.
In the deblurring model this is quite clear, and in the denoise it harder to see, but it is present.

In addition when examining the pictures themselves we can see about the same as in the MSE graphs - the more
blocks we added the better quality the pictures seemed. And as before it was harder to distinguish in the
denoise and the last highest blocks were virtually indistinguishable.
