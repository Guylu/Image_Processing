What happens (and why does this happen) to the result blending from section 4 image when:
Blending is performed with different image filters (filter_size_im = 1,3,5,7...).

Answer:

The filter_size_im decides the amount of blending done in each image in the gaussian pyramid.
When blending the images together we get less/more interactive blending between the pyramif levels.
and so this size determines the amount of blurring done that will be blended.
