What does it mean to multiply each level in a different value?
What do we try to control on?

Answer:

When building a pyramid of an image, what we conceptually do it decompose it
into band pass filters of different wavelengths.
If we sum up all those band pass filters we get the original image,
But if we sum them with different weights we can control the weights of different bands of the data -
remember that each band is a "patch" of wavelengths, and so we can get some bands more
expressed in the resulting image.
