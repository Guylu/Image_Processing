Record yourself using your smartphone (or any other recording device) and fast forward it using both
resize_spectrogram and resize_vocoder. Generate two audio files from the new samples, and explain
the differences.

Answer:

When runnign both functions on files with ration >1 the resulting files sound
about the same. The more significant changes occur when ration<1.
There resize_spectrogram struggles and has distortions in the sound - probably
caused by the waves overlapping and cancelling each other out.
resize_vocoder, does not have this issue because it has phase correction, and so
 sounds better.
