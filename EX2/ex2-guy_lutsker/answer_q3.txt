Why did you get two different magnitude images?

Answer:
First of all the convolution we defined is just an approximation of the "real"
continuous derivative, while the fourier derivative more closes resembles the
"real" derivative. And so we can expect the twp methods to have differences.

Second of all, most changes can probably be explained by the nature of the
fourier derivative formula - the formula removes the mean and gives much higher
"weight" to high frequencies, and so we would expect the fourier derivative to
have more fine details than the convolution derivative.
